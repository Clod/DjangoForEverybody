    This line renders all form fields from the Django form object.
    It automatically includes:
    - Labels for each field
    - Input fields (text, password, etc.)
    - Any validation errors
    - Required field indicators
    The actual fields shown depend on the form definition in forms.py
    Since there is no home/forms.py in this project, the AuthenticationForm 
    provided by Django is used for the login form. This form includes 
    fields for the username and password, and form.as_p is used in the template 
    to render these fields automatically. The form is handled in the view, 
    which validates the form and logs in the user if the form is valid.
    -->
    {{ form.as_p }}

    <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Login" />
    <input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next }}" />
